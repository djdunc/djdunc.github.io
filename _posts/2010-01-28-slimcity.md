We recently finished the last leg of a great project we had been working on for the World Economic Forum. Our task was to create an online presence for the SlimCity knowledge cards we had produced in 2009. The aim was to make the cards accessible to a broader audience than those at the SlimCity workshops. As such, all the cards are accessible via the [SlimCity website](http://www.driversofchange.com/slimcity/) where they can be read online, [browse the relationships between the cards](http://www.driversofchange.com/docvis/slimcity/), [download a pdf version](http://www.driversofchange.com/slimcity/#print) or leave comments on the themes raised by the cards.

Arup has been a knowledge partner of the [World Economic Forum’s SlimCity](http://www.weforum.org/en/initiatives/SlimCity/) initiative which is just coming to a close. SlimCity provided a global, risk-free platform where cities and the private sector could exchange best practices to deliver resource efficiency at the city level. One of SlimCity’s major deliverables was the [SlimCity Knowledge Cards](http://www.driversofchange.com/projects/slimcity-knowledge-cards.php), researched and produced by Arup (managed in our team by [Marcus Morrell](http://arupforesight.ning.com/profile/MarcusMorrell)).

The cards, which follow a similar format to the [Drivers of Change cards](http://www.driversofchange.com/doc/), were targeted primarily at City Mayors as well as CEOs from relevant sectors. They differ from Arup’s Drivers of Change cards in that they offer practical solutions to many of the problems facing cities, rather than raise questions and issues. In compiling the cards, Arup’s researchers selected content on the basis that any Mayor could ask the question “Could we do this in our city?” The were given access to the Forum’s membership and network and carried out in depth-in interviews in addition to desk research.
