Attended the industry opening event for [The Bartlett Fifteen end of year show 2025](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/events/2025/dec/bartlett-fifteen-show-2025) at Here East this week. A public exhibition celebrating fifteen months of radical, future-facing work by graduating Master’s students in Design for Manufacture, Design for Performance & Interaction, and Situated Practice.

The show highlights multi-sensory installations, film, structures, robotics, and ephemera, with projects presented at the 1:1 scale afforded by the amazing workspace in which they were created. Many thanks to DfM programme leader Peter Scully for showing me around and re-igniting our discussion around the critical importance of investment in upfront design as a strategy to reduce subsequent installation and operational debt. That concept of Poke Yoke is equally true for the maintenance debt of IoT systems. 

The event also provided an excellent opportunity to engage directly with students, who were keen to share the practical lessons learned during the making of their projects. Hat tip also to [Jonathan Tyrell](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/architecture/people/mphilphd-students/architectural-design-architectural-urban-history-theory-students/jonathan-tyrrell) Director of Exhibitions.

On until Wed 10th Dec [https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/events/2025/dec/bartlett-fifteen-show-2025](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/events/2025/dec/bartlett-fifteen-show-2025)

Looking at [links.duncanwilson.com](https://links.duncanwilson.com/), these parts of the internet crossed my path this week:

- great video of a [robot trash can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0XYANRosVo&t=256s)

- EMF2026 dates are out and [videos from last year are here](https://media.ccc.de/c/emf2024)

- Matt Webb has a [new business called inanimate](https://inanimate.tech/) which sounds super relevent to CE students

- and I love this [octopus robot arm](https://aiforgood.itu.int/speaker/spiral-robots-spirobs/)
