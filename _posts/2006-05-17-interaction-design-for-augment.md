[![](https://i0.wp.com/ambient.media.mit.edu/approachable/images/chair.jpg?w=180) Making Ubicomp Approachable](http://ambient.media.mit.edu/approachable/ "Interaction Design for Augmented Objects") – workshop at [UbiComp 2006](http://www.ubicomp.org/ubicomp2006/). Sounds like an interesting workshop…. Topics include:

\* Specific applications and scenarios for early adoption of augmented objects

\* Physical embodiment vs. external augmentation.

\* Functional vs. thought provoking/playful augmentation.

\* Augmenting accessories vs. tools.

\* Augmentation related or unrelated to the original function of the object

\* Everyday vs. special purpose interaction.

\* Original and augmented affordances, and their perception.

\* Cognitive barriers to object augmentation.

\* Trust issues related to augmented objects.

\* Social acceptability and consumer acceptance.
