[Crossbow](http://www.xbow.com/) – we are using this product at Arup – the Mica2, Mica2 dot and more recently the Micaz. Gateways include the MIB510 (with USB adapter) and the MIB600 ethernet gateway. Sensor boards include the MTS300 and 310’s, the MTS420 and the MDA500. We also have the Moteworks software.

Whilst not strictly WSN technology (but you can get zigbee and bluetooth add ons) we are also using [Arduino boards](http://www.arduino.cc/) to prototype sensor and actuator interfaces.

Also of interest are [SunSpots](http://www.sunspotworld.com/about.php) when they become available.

Others such as Urban Tapestries project are also using [MoteIV](http://www.moteiv.com/) as an alternative platform.
