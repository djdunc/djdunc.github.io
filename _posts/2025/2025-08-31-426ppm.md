Currently in the time between two cohorts of students. The existing have just submitted their final projects, and the new ones are arriving in a few weeks. This means cleaning up the lab and getting it ready for the next term. The big push happens in a couple of weeks but we are already starting to see the consequences of our learn thorugh making approach. Lots of 3D print waste.

The image above shows the results of the students clearing out their lockers and workspace. They are learning to design and make physical objects, and 3D printing is a great way to do this. However, it also generates a lot of waste. The image shows failed prints, support structures, and other bits and pieces that were printed but not used.

We have a pretty good system for recycling the electronic components, they go back into the kits we give to incoming students, or go into the shared component cupboard or "free parts to use" box. On my wish list is to explore how we can start to [recycle the 3D waste material back into direct use](https://www.filamentive.com/a-practical-guide-to-recycling-3d-print-waste-into-filament/) (vs recycling through [UCL waste management](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/estates/our-services/waste-reuse-and-recycling)). Maybe a potential project for someone from the next cohort of students?

On a related note, I noticed on my [e-ink bus notifier](https://www.iot.io/projects/2024/01/11/nook.html) that the CO2 levels in the atmosphere have just hit 426ppm. This feels significant to me since I was born at 326ppm. A timely reminder of the impact that our consumption and production habits have on the environment.

A reminder on why we have the annual rise and fall (via [NASA](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/carbon-dioxide/))

_"This annual rise and fall of CO2 levels is caused by seasonal cycles in photosynthesis on a massive scale. In Northern Hemisphere spring, plants come to life and draw in CO2 to fuel their growth. This begins the process of lowering the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. In northern autumn, plant growth stops or slows down, and the whole process reverses itself. Much of the plant matter decomposes, releasing CO2 back to the atmosphere."_

On the theme of consumption, I took delivery of some new wheels this week. The rear on my Vitus E-Substance (an alloy Prime Orra) unfortunately suffered a catastrophic split. Have been coveting a set of Hunt wheels for a while, so took the plunge and ordered a set of HUNT 650B Adventure Carbon Disc Wheels.
