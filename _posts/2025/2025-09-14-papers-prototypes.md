As we transition between academic years work is quite mixed. Still finishing marking from the last cohort, getting updated modules and the lab ready for start of term at end of September and trying to keep on top of research projects. Turns out these three weeks of September are my busiest! Below are some updates on 2 new papers, some prototype work to build a new light installation and a new whiskey.

The publication process means that it can sometimes take a year before work gets put into the public domain. This week we had two papers surface from last year, one in [Royal Society Interface - Towards NetZero for hospital operating theatres](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2025.0048) and the other in [PLOS One - Cohort profile: Design and methods for Project HERCULES](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0330863). Is always nice to be able to reflect back on work completed which always feels larger then when you are in the middle of it.  

I have been doing a fair bit of work on revamping my introduction to our IoT module for this incoming cohort. In particular the set-up of the workshops. This has also meant creating a new arduino project for the students to interface with. Last year the [Chrono Lumina](https://www.iot.io/blog/2024/11/08/chrono-lumina.html) interface worked really well but I also observed a few things I would differently (reliability of communications, complexity of control, limitations on animation). This year I am working with Simon to create a new light installation. Below are some teasers on work in progress.

Whiskey update, whilst replacing a Raasay Dun Cana (my current favourite) I also bought a Raasay Lassie.
