[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.ciria.org/acatalog/x421.jpg?w=150)](http://www.ciria.org/acatalog/X421.html "CIRIA X421")Came across this report at [Sponge](http://www.spongenet.org/) a \*sustainabilty development network for property and construction professionals in the UK\* via the [developing news](http://developingnews.blogspot.com/) blog. The MORI report commisioned by Sponge looked at the demand for zero carbon development. An interesting shift in public opinion reports that 64% of homeowners want sustainable features to be compulsory for all new homes but also they are willing to pay more for these features or services. Of interest: 44% don’t know how much they spend on utilities per month; 40% of people were willing to pay up to £25 per month for sustainable features.
