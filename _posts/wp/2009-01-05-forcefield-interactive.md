On Christmas Eve Forcefield Interactive went live with the addition of two sensor inputs to allow visitors to the exhibition to play with the light installation.

A kiosk inside the space as well as facing the outside of the window on Fitzroy Street allowed visitors to put their Oyster card on a reader and have their card trigger a unique color to travel throughout the light sculpture. Additionally, a color sensor inside the space allows visitors to place an object of color on a reader, select the color and send it traveling through the installation. The default light display is generated using [Perlin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise) noise with the 192 lights being controlled by a single [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/).

Other collaborators included [Tinker.it](http://www.tinker.it/en/Projects/Forcefield) and [Artificial Tourism](http://www.artificialtourism.com/)
