And in a flash term 1 finishes. This year we changed the organisation of the modules taught on the MSc CE programme to run in parallel over the 11 weeks of T1. Whilst there have been some positives to this (more space to think about the individual modules) the downsides have been greater (more intense start to term, more grouping of the assessments at end of term). Next year we will most likely revert to two sets of "short and fat" modules. We are always learning. The picture above was taken at the end of the last session of the term - I love that everyone looks so happy!

I am not sure if the smiles are relief that it is the end of the presentations or end of term, or if it is just because we have genuinely lovely group of students who are having fun learning together. I think it is the latter. The last session of term is typically the SDV (Spatial Data Vis) presentations run by Valerio so we choose to celebrate the completion of work in Italian style with some bubbly and panettone as we move to the winter break.

I only managed to catch half the presentations this year but the ones I saw were excellent - from Harry Potter inspired magic books telling stories about room usage in our buildings to Jonny Ive inspired radar stations showing information on train arrivals at Stratford station. Some really good examples of physical displays and augmented realities.
