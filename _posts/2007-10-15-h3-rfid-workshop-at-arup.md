I’m wishing that I could attend all of this workshop but the best i can do is a bit at the start and the end…. H3: RFID is the second of a series of hardware hacking workshops in London organised by [tinker.it](http://tinker.it/). [Massimo Banzi](http://www.tinker.it/en/People/HomePage) (Arduino founder [www.arduino.cc](http://www.arduino.cc)) facilitates the event with Matt Biddulph ([www.dopplr.com](http://www.dopplr.com)) The event will be held at the Arup offices and is ideal for anyone wanting to explore RFID and Arduino. The entry fee even includes an RFID kit to take away to show off your prototype. For more info visit the [event page](http://tinkerit.eventwax.com/h3-rfid-workshop). Hopefully the first of many.
