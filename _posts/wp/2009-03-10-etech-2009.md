Am at ETech 2009 this week. The event has just started with Tim O’Reilly talking about his grand challenges, a focus on scenarios and a really nice couple of slides on the characteristics of rewarding innovation. Paraphrasing…

“think of business as a road trip, you need to keep an eye on gas tank to make sure you don’t run out of fuel, but the trip is not a tour of petrol stations”

One to remember for anyone running internal R&amp;D funding programmes…
