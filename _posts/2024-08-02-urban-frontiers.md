This week we opened the [Urban Frontiers Exhibition](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa/events/2024/aug/urban-frontiers-exhibition) at One Pool Street. This has been a collaboration with [SHIFT](https://shiftlondon.co.uk), our long term collaborators and friends at the London Legacy Development Corporation. Led by [Andy](https://connected-environments.org/people/) at our side this has been a fun way to gather together examples of our current and past projects in the park.

The blurb for the event says:

_SHIFT is working with innovators on everything from building materials made from biochar to AI-powered buildings. These artefacts, curated by SHIFT and hosted by UCL, show how startups, researchers and communities are already building tomorrow's city. The pop-up exhibition features physical solutions that will act as the building blocks of our cities, digital solutions tackling pressing issues and experimental interventions straddling both the physical and digital._

Lots of photos of the exhibits are on Flickr:
