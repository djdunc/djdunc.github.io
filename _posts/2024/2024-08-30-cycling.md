Back in April I spent a day at the outside track at the Velodrome in QEOP trying out road bikes. I seem to be on the cusp of medium and large bikes (but have always bought large) so wanted to try out some mediums. A day event organised by cyclist magazine meant we got to try out a number of brands over the course of the day. It was excellent and made me rethink my plans to get a road bike - maybe my gravel bike was actually fine...

I was really impressed by the Condor folk and ended up booking in a bike fit session with them a month or so later. I spent an hour cycling on a Wahoo KICKR ROLLR getting my seat, bars and shoes all tweaked here and there. With measurements done, new insoles purchased and seat lowered a little, I am now much more confident that I am not overreaching and I am in a comfortable position on the bike.

A few months on and my longer riders are much more comfortable - have just spent a lovely couple of days cycling on the North Yorkshire Moors on routes that will be part of the Tour of Britain later this week.
