One of my summer reads was [Do Interesting](https://www.counter-print.co.uk/products/do-interesting) by Russell Davies (top of the pile). Will be using this with our students to encourage them to observe and record what they see in the world around them. This reminded me that I want to do more of this.

I tend to remember things by taking pictures and have created a habit of noticing and collecting information (mainly photos), but have not been so good at sharing. I fell out of that habit while working for a company on projects that I wasn’t allowed to share so freely. So here we go, let’s see if I can notice and share something weekly on here.

PS - I noticed another of Russell's books in that pile, Everything I Know about Life I Learned from PowerPoint!
