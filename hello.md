This site is a collection of pointers to my work and projects I have worked on. The social links at the footer of the page point to things I find interesting ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/djdunc) / [Mastodon](https://mastodon.me.uk/@dunc) ), I tend to take pictures to remind myself of things ([Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pseudonomad)) and store bits of the internet "for later" on [Pinboard](http://pinboard.in/u:dunc). To find out more about my career journey jump over to [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/duncanwilson). If you want to take a look at what I listen to (other than BBC R4 and R6) take a look over on [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/djdunc) where I have been occasionally scrobbling since 2006.

## BIOGRAPHY
Duncan is Professor of Connected Environments in The Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA) at University College London. His research focuses on how emerging technologies such as connected sensors and cognitive computing can augment our understanding of the built and natural environment. He is a Chartered Engineer (IET) with a PhD from UCL in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Vision. He has over 25yrs of digital technology, R&D, innovation and strategy experience, primarily working at the interface between industry and academia.

The Connected Environments research at CASA feeds into the Future Living Institute at UCL East (creation of a new Masters on Connected Environments and living labs in QEOP) and focuses on three core research vectors; cognitive computing – AI at the edge of the network on resource constrained devices; extra sensory computing – novel methods for capturing data and humans receiving it; and spatial reasoning systems – how we can augment / improve our world models with continuous post occupancy information. He is Director of Enterprise and Partnerships for CASA providing support for the department in developing industry collaborations.

Previously he was responsible for driving the research agenda of the London based Sustainable Connected Cities research institute for Intel Labs Europe with UCL, Imperial College and the Future Cities Catapult. He directed work of 90+ researchers working on 30+ projects and grew the initial $5m Intel investment to $15m via collaborations with external parties and UK / EU research grants. Prior to Intel, he co-created foresight and innovation capability at Arup. Key projects included creating the Drivers of Change concept (Strategic thinking tools), applying Internet of Things technologies to Post Occupancy Evaluation and conceiving, designing and developing a website to manage a global internal innovation stage-gate funding process.

He was a member of the Smart London Board, has served on the EU Expert Group on the Internet of Things, is a keen maker, was a Code Club volunteer at a local primary school from 2013-2019 and is a CAS Barefoot volunteer.
