The [home solar / battery system](https://moixa.com) has been running for just over 5 years. While the system has been running smoothly in the background, we've encountered a few hiccups over the past six months. Such challenges are perhaps an inherent part of being an early adopter of new technologies. Nevertheless, during this period, we have generated about 1.5 megawatt-hours of energy per year from our roof. I had started to think about expanding the number of panels on our roof (we have 9, space for 6 more) so maybe these "issues" are an opportunity to kickstart that process. So what are the challenges we have been having.

First up, the battery looks like it might be reaching end of life - an issue with the controller and the product no longer being manufactured means that when they come out to check it they will mst likely be removing the system (which means I am in the market for a new battery). Second, when I went to view the amount of solar being generated via an app on my phone I noticed that it was no longer available on the app store (I have my phone setup to offload apps that I don't use frequently - mistake). Luckily the app was also on an iPad so I can still see our data. But I wanted to start saving the data elsewhere - just in case.

This [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/djdunc/58b11f8e0dd00cdf8ebb5569df32e96c) is running on a RPi at home that I use to control various things (like the [Bus Nook](https://www.iot.io/projects/2024/01/11/nook.html)). It connects directly to the Solar Inverter on my home network which seems to be the conduit for getting data out to the Zanussi app.

I am using Beautiful Soup to process data from web page served on the Inverter itself - this gives me power now in Watts, todays cumulative Energy in kWh's and the system total cumulative energy in kWh's. I discovered that the inverter web page seems to go off line regularly once the sun goes down (is is solar powered?) so the extra bit of script logging the readings to a log file were implemented so that when i cannot connect to the inverter i still send the last known readings to the MQTT broker (since I might want to display the days total / total energy). Once I had implemented that I realised that using retained messages on the MQTT broker would probably have been a better route to take...
