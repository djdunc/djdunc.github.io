Chris was at Poptech 2007 last week. Great blog coverage at [blogginglive](https://www.poptech.org/blogginglive/) and a nice post by [Ethan Zuckerman](http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2007/10/19/poptech-sustainable-and-unsustainable-cities/). Chris used the [DoC voting app](http://driversofchange.com/poptech/) to canvass opinion on current drivers. The top votes (today) with 85 are Peak Oil and Climate Change with US Fascism taking 59â€¦
