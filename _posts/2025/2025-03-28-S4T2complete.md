Term 2 came to a close with a week of final group project presentations, voting for the CE 2025 mug design, a last lecture on Dead IoT and a visit to the [Hampstead Observatory](https://www.hampsteadscience.ac.uk/observatory.html) to see the partial solar eclipse.

The projects for GPP were really well thought through this year, the theme was about remote connection and included devices: Aligned - remote communication only when you are pointing towards each other across the globe, LitMate - a shared reading experience, HotStone - communicating connection through warmth, Bond Note - sending handwritten messages through a digital device, Guiding Glow - lighthouses signalling safety of loved ones and Worry Free - an interface for connecting the elderly to their loved ones.

Had some great mug entries this year - was very close but the group photo won out!

A chance message from Yaman via slack meant a quick cycle over to Hampstead to catch the partial solar eclipse. I was only vaguely aware of the observatory next to Whitestone Pond - the [highest point in inner London](https://www.heathandhampstead.org.uk/heath/did-you-know-whitestone-pond-flagstaff/). Really lovely volunteers explaining how things work and lots of ways to look at the partial eclipse. I wanted to ask about the RPi and arduinos controlling the telescope but they were really busy focusing on the main event! Need to make a mental note to book onto one of their [open evenings via eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/hampstead-scientific-society-54889172333). They also have a lovely weather station which is currently out of commission - might be an opportunity for a volunteer.
