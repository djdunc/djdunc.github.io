[Arduino Xbee, Zigbee wireless sensor and actuator iterface](http://ciam.dyndns.org/~vitamin/danslchamp/mrtof/AXIC/index.html "Arduino Xbee, Zigbee wireless sensor and actuator iterface") forwarded by [Gonzalo](http://www.artificialtourism.com/) and a potential avenue to explore for bop prototypes. BUT, would need to think about all the apps needed to get the real benefit of the \*wirelessness\*. The radio removes the need to wire together two communicating arduinos but thats it. To get a network setup and running would need to source methods for multihop networking etc.
