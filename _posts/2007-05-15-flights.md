Nice example of time lapse photo. Posted on [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/superlocal/273964362/) but saw via [everyoneforever](http://www.everyoneforever.com/) – amazing photograph currently showing at the Seoul City Museum in South Korea.[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.everyoneforever.com/images_fullsize/70-261.jpg?w=400)](http://www.everyoneforever.com/content/2006-10-19/flights/ "Everyone Forever / Photography / Flights")
