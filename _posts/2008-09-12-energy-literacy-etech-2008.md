Great presentation by Saul Griffith at ETech this year. Two points stick. 25min 25sec in he compares his “low estimate” of his actual energy usage and it turns out to be much higher than all other footprints currently being used on the internet. The slide after then makes the point beautifully by suggesting the next Nobel prize for economics should be awared to the person able to accurately calculate our energy usage… The second point was 36min 40sec in. The list of what we as individuals can do was brilliant “these are all things we want to do anyway” – spot on. So why don’t we do it.

I admire his goals for 2010 and really hope he obtains them.
