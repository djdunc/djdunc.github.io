I spent the weekend at the [Yahoo Hackday](http://openhacklondon.pbworks.com/) last week. As [Crave](http://crave.cnet.co.uk/software/0,39029471,49302231,00.htm) puts it

> “The idea behind it was simple: you’ve got exactly 24 hours to hack together the most interesting, innovative, useful or fun piece of software or hardware, using developer tools from Yahoo, or anyone else for that matter. ”

[David Filo](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/may/14/yahoo-david-filo) opened the event, I learnt alot about the Yahoo API’s available – a great way for them to show me what i could be using… and thought the talk by [Rasmus Lerdorf on hacking with PHP](http://talks.php.net/show/openhack) was great.

Next steps – how to organise a hackday at Arup for the virtual design, BIM, GIS and intranet communities…
