Take aways to think about

– how do we trade and share, and which one do we choose to do when?

– open in (Dell ideastorm), open out (wikipedia)

– reduce barrier to entry and increase motivation to contribute – when the lines cross you get participation.

Glyn Moody <http://opendotdotdot.blogspot.com/> is a technology writer. He is best known for his book Rebel Code: Linux and the Open Source Revolution (2001). It describes the evolution and significance of the free

software and open source movements with many interviews of all the notable hackers.

Historically the biggest factors reducing openess came from the enclosures of land (statute of Merton 13 century), artistic endeavor (copyright) and scientific knowledge (patents).

statute of anne 1710 – first reference to copyright – 14 years plus option for further 14.

google – against intellectual monopoly – a book on why intellectual property reduces innovation.

\*we started with openess, we lost it, but current trends are showing an interest in returning to openess – the earth as an open commons

internet backbone – google relied on to build product and the idea that the data was open so they could index it – some companies are now trying to sue them saying that they should have seeked approval first… imagine that.

wealth and happiness – stats from 1975-88 show that whilst US economy doubled the levels of happiness did not change. (source: GSS)

Charles Leadbeater <http://www.charlesleadbeater.net/> is a leading authority on innovation and creativity. He has advised companies, cities and governments around the world on innovation strategy and drawn on that experience in writing his latest book We-think: the power of mass creativity, which charts the rise of mass, participative approaches to innovation from science and open source software, to computer games and political

campaigning.

if you dont want to read the book watch the youtube video… one comment asked when do we share and when do we trade – interesting issue.

dangers of openess are a) they are very fragile, b) the coopting of the idea – once it grows it often changes

dell idea storm – 10000 ideas from outside the company – an example of open in (using openess to drive product development) the opposite is open out when ideas are shared outwards (e,g, linux wikipedia…)

4 things to think about – with who, what, method, motivation

discussion

does the current economic model deny the value of the commons – e.g. the social benefit of academia and government strategically investing in research.

happiness and the recognition economy

“open systems are cheaper, more adaptive and generally lead to increased innovation” CL

for a business is open source / open innovation just a means an to end or is it a cultural change in values

Robin – 2 quests

– obama has introduced a new peer to peer way of getting elected, but now he is in power how does he govern using these principles? (actually over half the campaign was still putting the adverts on the tv at the right time)

– the economics of openness – how to get a community to start taking action? – the community needs to already exist before it can do something hard – that is why pledgebank.co.uk only allows you to get together with 10 others for your first pledges.

Dept Work Pensions – the right to bid project – any group of people can get together to bid to do something better.

collaborative urban design – upmystreet.co.uk – some people are asking for their built environment to be improved.
