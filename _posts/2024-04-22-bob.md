We are a fans of Bob Mortimer in our house. My wife maybe a little too much. A friend lent me "[And Away](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/sep/26/and-away-review-how-bob-mortimer-went-from-sidekick-to-standalone)" a while back but it is still sitting on the shelf in the living room waiting to be read. My capacity for buying books seems to exceed my capacity to read them. I noticed the audio book a couple of weeks ago on Spotify so that has been my “listening while doing odd jobs” around the house.

I had loads of “laugh out loud” moments which the kids find a bit weird when I am walking around the house with headphones on. I really liked his call out at the end to bring the introverts into the conversation. Please do that. 

I also liked his lists. So this post is a reminder of all the things that I need to make sure I teach my kids. Here are my first 33 to get me going...

- Find people that make you laugh and spend as much time with them as you can
