Had a really interesting evening at the [at abrahams](http://www.atabrahams.com) event hosted by Arup on the theme of “collaborleaders”. at abrahams is curated by [abrahams](http://www.abrahams.uk.com/) and [Claire Curtice Publicists](http://www.clairecurtice.co.uk) with this event chaired by Sophie Howarth from [the School of Life](http://www.theschooloflife.com/). The evening highlights were Philip Sheppard playing an impromptu cello solo and then later joining Steve Lodder and John Etheridge to show how three musicians can come together and improvise a piece of music – collaboration at its best. The video below is a bit shakey – i had to improvise 😉 but watch how the three are continually watching each other – to quote one of the general observations from the evening “the non verbal communication amongst the collaborators was visible”.

[atabrahams impromptu collaboration](http://vimeo.com/5007757) from [Duncan Wilson](http://vimeo.com/user673248) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).

Other highlights included:

re the cello “it’s a Banks probably made near here in 1750” i wonder which of todays tools we will be using in 2250

re workshops – can you be forced to collaborate or do have to want to collaborate?

re architect and designer – “the collaboration only involved about 4 hours of working together with each other” but then many hours of the teams working together towards the finished product

re can it be built – “not yes you can, but yes we can”

re the ego in the collaboration – the economist does not have signed articles it is a team effort by the editing staff.

and finally… a poem by Roger McGough for the egotistical collaborator

The Leader

I wanna be the leader

I wanna be the leader

Can I be the leader?

Can I? I can?

Promise? Promise?

Yippee I’m the leader

I’m the leader

OK what shall we do?
