Quick one this week. Busy with teaching and first cold of the season. Highlight was a new bike arriving, a [Sonder Camino TI GRX1](https://alpkit.com/products/sonder-camino-ti-grx1). Have not had chance to get out on it yet, have mainly just been looking at it. Considered putting it on the wall as a work of art. Why have a picture of a bike when you can have the bike? Will add more photos to [bike album on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pseudonomad/albums/72177720331779807/) when I get it outside.

Work wise spent time configuring lora devices on TTN for the UCL200 project and working out the power requirements for the lights at the Manifold art installation at Pool Street East. Project is getting there...

Looking at [links.duncanwilson.com](https://links.duncanwilson.com/), these parts of the internet crossed my path this week:
