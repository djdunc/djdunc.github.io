Finally bought a pen plotter. I have been intrigued by these since spotting [Sketchy](http://www.jarkman.co.uk/catalog/robots/sketchy.htm), a delta robot drawing faces at Maker Faire Newcastle in 2014. Later that year I had a go at [making one](https://www.iot.io/projects/2014/03/01/delta-robot.html), but never quite finished it. I even explored using a [Kossel 3D printer](https://reprap.org/wiki/Kossel) as a basis for creating an arduino controlled pen plotter. But in the end procrastination got the better of me and after a chat with [Dan Catt](https://revdancatt.com) at [Papercamp](https://www.iot.io/blog/2024/09/26/papercamp.html) last September I was motivated to order a [Bantam Tools NextDraw (8511)](https://store.bantamtools.com/products/bantam-tools-nextdraw-8511) so that I could start focusing on generating line art.

The NextDraw pretty much works straight out the box so I was up and running once Inkscape was set-up.

My first print was inspired by Joy Divisions Unknown Pleasures album cover of a stacked plot of the radio emissions given out by a pulsar. I made it using [Processing](https://processing.org) which will likely be my main tool for creating plots although I do have plans for some Computer Vision based drawings using Python.

The first drawings are [on GitHub](https://github.com/djdunc/plotter/tree/main) and I plan to try and keep publishing work in progress here.

The picture below has been hanging in the hallway since 2017 as a constant reminder of this project in progress! It's a line drawing of Finn made at Brighton Maker Faire with a robot arm.

I aim to keep posting plots of the week into this folder (and on weekly blog posts). Some useful resources on getting started are listed below.
