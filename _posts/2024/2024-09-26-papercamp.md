Had a lovely time at [Papercamp 3](https://www.designswarm.com/papercamp-3/) at [St Brides](https://sbf.org.uk/about/) last weekend. A mix of some really interesting talks and an awesome visit to the St Brides Foundation print workshops. The event was organised by [Alex](https://www.designswarm.com/), her strapline for the event was "exploring the weird and wonderful world of physical & digital paper."

Was great to see some of [Dan Catts work](https://revdancatt.com) in real life and loved his talk about robot hand writing, AI journaling and his motivation for capturing his handwriting in was that his dad and grandad were not able. I made notes to explore axidraw  drawing machines, kitty and reflective journaling with AI. His blurb for the presentation is below.

_“Daniel really loves the idea of journaling, but he’s too busy to do it, and besides his handwriting is steadily getting worse. So he’s doing what any sensible person would do and handed over all responsibility for journal writing to an AI (Kitty), who he’s probably unwisely also given his encoded handwriting and access to a drawing machine to. A short talk & demo on how this hasn’t turned out to be a terrible idea, algorithmic handwriting, and the joy of fountain pens & index cards.” From Papercamp website._

Lovely to also see a hat tip to Connected Environments from [Matt Webb](https://interconnected.org)

If you get chance to go to a printing workshop jump at the opportunity - the volunteers tell a really interesting story on the history of printing. In particular I loved their introduction to mono-type, Lino-type and the Flong.
