**The 7 themes for ICT in FP7**

Introduced main features and proposed priorities for 2007-08. First ICT call in Jan/Feb 2007. Seven \*challenges\* are proposed each with several \*target\* areas for research:

1\. network and service infrastructure (250 mil euro) (Sarah: items such as built in security and trust, full support of distributed value chains – SOA, computing as utility)

2\. cognitive systems, robotics and interaction (450 mil euro) (Alvise, Tristan, Darren: looking at things like robots adapting to context, machines and systems that understand their users and/or their environments\*\*, systems that understand multimedia and multi modal digital information)

3\. components, systems, engineering (200 mil euro) (at electronic level – not for Arup)

4\. digital libraries and content (400 mil euro) (Rebecca G, Tom, Tony, Kevin: mass-individualisation of learning experiences with ICT, efficient editing and knowledge management systems)

5\. sustainable and personalised healthcare (175 mil euro) (Gavin, Phil: they mentioned computational modelling and simulation of organs as a specific objective, also met chap from Primal Pictures – http://www.primalpictures.com/ or http://www.anatomy.tv/)

6\. mobility, environment, energy (180 mil euro) (David, Amanda: items included optimised traffic management, integrated management systems to monitor and react to environmental risks\*)

7\. ICT for independent living and inclusion (75 mil euro) (Rebecca M: ICT solutions that will substantially reduce the 30% of the population currently not using ICT, user friendly systems beyond the PC and current technologies\*\*)

(For info i am interested in challenge 1: target = reconfigurability, adaptability, interoperability, service composition and challenge and those targets above marked with \*\*)

**Funding schemes**

3 types of project:

A. Collaboration projects (STREPS – or IP)

B. Networks of excellence

C. Coordination and support actions

2100 mil total split as follows

1150 mil euro Jan 07 call – 1 stage submission (just long prop)

650 mil euro May 07 call – 2 stage submission (short then full)

200 mil euro Nov 07 call – 2 stage submission (short then full)

FET futures and emerging technologies open 65 mil euro over 2 years proactive 125 mil euro

fixed over head rate they use (where people cannot demonstrate their own ie SME’s) is 60% (dropping to 40% for projects starting in 2009)

Rules for participation: minimum 3 different member states must be involved, big co’s (Arup) get 50% funding for R&amp;D and demonstrator type activity (Uni, public, SME’s get 75%) and 100% funding for management activities.

Full details available in early 2007

Industry evaluators needed (call in november from site below) paid 450 (euro?) per day plus expenses.

more detail at <http://fp6uk.ost.gov.uk/> if you register you will get notified of announcements, calls etc. and DW has ppt handouts from day for those who want to see them (just add a comment at bottom).

**Application tips:**

Evaluators have to read many of these – keep it simple, to the point, understandable on page one and then show why you are the dream team

Reference the ETP reports – especially the SRA’s, strategic research agendas – since the technology programmes have been setup to influence the agenda of the FP7 programme (Arup are leading ECTP PICT – european construction technology platform, processing and ICT – this MUST be referenced for built environment projects) – <http://cordis.europa.eu/ist/about/techn-platform.htm>

Don’t wait for call to start to pull together dream team since once call is made time is short…

Get advice from the UK National Contact Point (Peter Walters) – go talk to them and see what they think of your application.
