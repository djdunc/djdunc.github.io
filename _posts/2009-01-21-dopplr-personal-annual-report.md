Another great piece of work by Dopplr and this time it is even more personal. Just received my [dopplr2008report.pdf](/assets/docs/2008_dopplr2008report.pdf). 50,000km traveled, away from home for 55 days and the velocity of a duck (5.73 km/h). I love the timeline that links through to the flickr images – just need to figure out how to add one in for Ambleside…
