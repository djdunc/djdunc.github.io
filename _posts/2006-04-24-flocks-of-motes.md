[Paper in IEEE Computer](http://lazowska.cs.washington.edu/r8hemi.lo3.pdf) and course info for

[CSE 466: Software for Embedded Systems (Wi’06)](http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/cse466/06wi/ "CSE 466: Software for Embedded Systems (Wi'06)") a great demo of ad hoc networks and emergent behaviour. Each mote in the network sings a bird song. If another mote near by is also singing the same song it reinforces that tune. If they all sing the same then someone starts a new one. If no one nearby is singing the same then they try a new one. This way an emergent flocking starts – nice…

follow up with [Bruce Hemingway](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/bruceh/ "Bruce Hemingway") to request a way to replicate demo.
