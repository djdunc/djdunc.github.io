![Casa Band Xmas 2024](/assets/img/casaband2024.gif)

A short one these week since I am still recovering from the CASA Xmas band! Great to see so many alumni and friends at the [Water Rats](https://www.thewaterratsvenue.london) this week for the CASA Xmas party. The band was one of my first experiences of CASA about 10 years ago it obviously had an impact since I thought "I would like to work with them". They reformed this year after a hiatus over Covid years. Simon and Steve were representing from the UCL East CE cohort and it was great to see one of the USS students stepping up as lead singer alongside Thomas. Adam was in his happy place on drums!

Am looking forward to seeing the band playing at UCL East in 2025 - maybe a [CUPUM highlight?](https://cupum.co)
