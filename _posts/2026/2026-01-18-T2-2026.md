T2 2025/26 got underway, kicking off with strategy and joined by Lloyd to talk about the practicalities of getting smart campus work through lean business cases. A couple of hours spent with the Provost who was visiting CASA to meet staff and get insight into the work we do. Some really good conversations on what we do well and where we hope to get support over the next few years. A little side project went live for the SU.

Connected Environments have built an IoT Bus Tracker for an [excellent student led shuttle service](https://studentsunionucl.org/articles/ucl-east-shuttle-bus-your-journey-just-got-easier) between Stratford Station and UCL East. The service is run completely by students and is free to use. Hosted on UCL servers, the live view below of the shuttle is at: [https://bus.cetools.org/](https://bus.cetools.org/) another living example of the work we teach in Connected Environments.

Looking at [links.duncanwilson.com](https://links.duncanwilson.com/), these parts of the internet crossed my path this week:

- [a cool visualisation of the evoloution of Paris](https://kottke.org/26/01/a-visualization-of-the-evolution-of-paris-300-bce-to-2025)
- a [familiar viewpoint](https://www.hepi.ac.uk/2026/01/10/weekend-reading-what-if-in-trying-to-fix-universities-we-are-quietly-unmaking-them/) on the current state of UK universities
