A little project over the 2023/24 Christmas break involved putting back into use an old Barnes and Noble Nook that had been sitting in a drawer for years. The goal was to display when buses will be arriving at the bus stop at the top of our road using the [excellent TfL bus API](https://api-portal.tfl.gov.uk/apis). I was also keen to include some info on weather - ideally I wanted to show the likelyhood of rain that day - useful when you are cycling to work.

The project involved several steps that I kept coming back to over the course of a month - but it broke down to the following:

- working out how to open up the nook so that I could work out the device type
- working out how / if I could root the nook so that I could display my own content
- working out how to display a web page as a proxy for content display
- working out how to install it as a display near my front door 

The initial searching around trying to work out approaches to do this took a while but then I came across this project by Edent which was really helpful in working out how to get everything working: [https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2020/02/turn-an-old-ereader-into-an-information-screen-nook-str/](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2020/02/turn-an-old-ereader-into-an-information-screen-nook-str/) - I recommend following his notes on:

- updating the nook ([via Barnes and Noble](https://help.barnesandnoble.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/4212#ManualDL))
- rooting the nook ([Downloading Nook manager and installing](https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2040351))
- installing a launcher ([I used Relaunch](https://xdaforums.com/t/relaunch-the-best-nst-launcher-version-1-4-0-just-released.3060782/))
- installing electric sign ([download from here](https://apkpure.com/electric-sign/com.sugoi.electricsign))

Note - to install the launcher and electric sign you connect to the nook via USB and run commands similar to these:

```
adb install com.gacode.relaunchx_200106000.apk
```

```
adb install Electric Sign_1.0.3_Apkpure.apk
```

(as a note to self I had to setup Android Studio on my home mac to do this)

This gives you a Nook that you can then work with to display html content - the last step was generating and hosting the web content to display.

Given that I had a Raspberry Pi running at home that was already serving a webpage on my local network I opted to serve the page from the same device. The end result was:

- A Python script runs from crontab once per minute to generate a webpage - [bus.py](https://github.com/djdunc/nook/blob/main/bus.py)
- The Nook is on the same network as the RPi serving the webpage
- The Nook calls this html page and uses "electic sign" to save as screensaver (I pointed the screensaver in Nook settings to use Electric Sign)
- Electric Sign is set to update once a minute
- The bus.py script queries the bus stops API once per minute to get updates - I found my [bus stop id using this page](https://tfl.gov.uk/maps/bus?Input=Muswell%20Hill&InputGeolocation=51.590811,-0.14292) - hint, click on bus stop and then get "station information".
- I request weather data once an hour to reduce api calls to [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/api)
- I bought a cheap picture frame, removed glass, created cardboard surround, cut notch for cable and taped it all together (battery life not quite good enough for the number of updates I was wanting - once per minute - hence had to power the device)
