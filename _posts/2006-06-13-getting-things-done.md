Met with [Dan Hill](http://www.cityofsound.com/) today talking about interactivity in the built environment and away days – an unusual mix… the conversation reminded me to look up: [Getting started with “Getting Things Done” | 43 Folders](http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/08/getting-started-with-getting-things-done/ "Getting started with “Getting Things Done” | 43 Folders")
