Feels like we have only just started on Term One 2024/25 on the MSc Connected Environments but I am already processing applications for 2025/26! Some really great applications so far and I really enjoy reading applicants personal statements that describe their motivation for coming to study IoT, AR, VR, AI at The Bartlett. A really good cross section of students so far! We have a [virtual open day coming up on Wednesday](https://app.geckoform.com/events-embed/#/events-embed?uuid=21FO00icsae3hl00ksz94frvhy&event_field_id=24157) (27th Nov 2024 11am) if you want to learn more or have some questions about the programme. I am also always happy to answer any questions so please [feel free to get in touch](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/38619).

As I look back through the past couple of weeks of photos from the Lab I thought I would share some here.
