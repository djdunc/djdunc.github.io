We are just over half way through the first couple of MSc Connected Environments modules and the students have presented their first work. After an “introduction to arduino” workshop each student was tasked with making a physical prototype that introduced themselves and their interests.

We deliberately gave them very little time for this task since we were looking for quick prototypes that communicated an idea rather than demonstrated a functional device. This part of the process is one that can often have quite mixed results. For some the challenge of making something imperfect can be a blocker, for others it allows some freedom to talk about ideas.

This year we had some fantastic presentations, some great crafting and some lovely insights to the students we will be sharing this year with.
