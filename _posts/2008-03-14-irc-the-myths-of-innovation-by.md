Have just finished pulling together and writing up the second in a series of internal Arup workshops on innovation. The series are sponsored by our Europe Region Design and Technical Executive and are aimed at stimulating thought around innovation amongst some of our senior leaders. It was fun to research the \*overview of innovation\* presentation since it has been a few years since I have had to talk about this stuff. One book I came across was [The Myths of Innovation](http://www.librarything.com/work/2875445/book/20854907) by Scott Berkun. (I actually picked up a free copy of this book at [Scifoo 2007](http://blogs.driversofchange.com/emtech/2007/08/) but had not read it until recently). I loved the stories around the myths and found it a very useful way to describe the effort that normally goes into innovating. I couldn’t attend the innovation reading circle meeting around this book but Nico has a great overview page as per usual and links to a Googletalk by Scott Berkun which is worth a watch if you don’t like reading books…
