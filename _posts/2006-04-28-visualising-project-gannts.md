[Ask E.T.: Project Management Graphics (or Gantt Charts)](http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=000076&topic_id=1 "Ask E.T.: Project Management Graphics (or Gantt Charts)") – came across this forum from a newsletter email from brucemaudesign. A fantastic forum discussion thread still active after 4 years!! Lots of posts from large civil projects to novels to movies to F1 teams regarding how to visualise the many interdependencies in managing multivariant projects – did they use a Gannt chart for the great wall of china.

From one of the posts a link to good PM resource from ex Columbia uni prof: <http://www.projectreference.com/>
