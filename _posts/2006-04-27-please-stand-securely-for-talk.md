[One Day, That Economy Ticket May Buy You a Place to Stand – New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/25/business/25seats.html?ex=1146628800&en=fd6c6ca4710a7acf&ei=5070&emc=eta1 "One Day, That Economy Ticket May Buy You a Place to Stand - New York Times") Charles forwarded me this link after our recent workshop on Airport Retail.
