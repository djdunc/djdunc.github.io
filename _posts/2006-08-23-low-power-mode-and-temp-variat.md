Set-up another 19 node network of Micaz motes with 6 mts310 sensor boards and 13 mts300 sensor boards. Running mts310CB code in low power mode. I initially sat all the motes together (image above) to see how close the various sensor readings were, a crude callibration test. The graph below shows that for the first 12 hour + period there was quite a variation on for example the temperature sensor – a variation of 1.5 degree C – more than i was expecting. I will log a call with xbow help desk.

The other reason for the experiement was to see how long the batteries last in low power mode… will post the results when I have them.
