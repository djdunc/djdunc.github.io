Another busy week in the lab as our students bring together their dissertation projects ready for exhibition in Marshgate. The show is open until 5th September so do please call in if you are in the Olympic Park area - it is open to the public.

Leah and Simon have done a fantastic job setting up the exhibition space and the students have responded with some fantastic installations made even more impressive by the fact this is the first time exhibiting for most of the students.

The brief set by Andy and Martin was to "Sense, Deploy, Communicate" an IoT system. Projects have ranged from meditation devices to water sensing technologies.

It was lovely to see all the projects in one place and to get chance to ask students about projects I hadn't been directly involved with.

Marshgate provided a lovely backdrop for the exhibition and hopefully this experimental exhibition will now become an annual event.
