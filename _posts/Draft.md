One of my summer reads was [Do Interesting](https://www.counter-print.co.uk/products/do-interesting) by Russell Davies. Will be using this with our students to encourage them to observe and record what they see in the world around them. This reminded me that I want to do more of this. I tend to remember things by taking pictures and have created a habit of noticing and collecting information (mainly photos), but have not been so good at sharing. I fell out of that habit while working for a company on projects that I wasn’t allowed to share so freely. So here we go, let’s see if I can notice and share something weekly on here.
