In Versaille at the European Construction Technology Platform ([ECTP](http://www.ectp.org)) conference. The ECTP has been created to establish a voice for the european constuction sector with the European Commission (EC) and in particular at the moment Framework 7 funding. The days were a mix of EC representative presentations, member presentations (from industry and academy) and a series of brokerage events around the 7 focus areas of the platform (networking opportunities to support the creation of collaborative projects). The focus areas are: innovative use of underground space, a living cultural heritage for an attractive Europe, ICT supported new integrated processes for the consturction sector, high added value construction materials, resource efficient and clean buildings, sustainable management of transport and utility networks, environment and quality of life for all. (Arup are coordinating the ICT processes focus area with VTT and facilitated the brokerage workshop in quite a bizarre room â€“ Salle Lulli in the Palais des Congres)

The Strategic Research Agenda for ECTP is available for downloadable at <http://www.ectp.org>

The final ECTP road-map is due to be published to the EC in March but funding for FP7 starts in early 2007.

Presented the DTI Bop project at the event in a poster session for national technology programme projects. Other relevent posters are [posted to flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/foresightbydesign/sets/72157594388222092/).
