Very much felt like a liminal space between years this week. A visit to Middlesbrough, last and first swims of the year and preparations on the allotment. Plus a little too much sugary food and fun and games on New Year’s Eve.

A road trip north meant a lovely ride up into Guisborough woods - including a chance to revisit the location of a previous mountain biking accident which led to an A&E visit.

Plus a walk by the sea with family.

Back in London meant lido swims and allotment fettling. That last swim brought my total for the year to 159.6 km. If I had realised I would have done 8 more lengths.

Didn’t quite feel like a shift into a new year this one. Let’s see what 2026 brings. Supermoon over the allotment.
