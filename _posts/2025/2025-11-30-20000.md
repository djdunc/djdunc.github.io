Today I am 20,000 days old. Not sure if that means anything. But I had a reminder pop up in my calendar. Not sure when or why I put it in there. I quite like the idea of celebrating days rather than years though, makes it a bit more random. To celebrate I went to check out my next bike (Sonder Camino).

Otherwise a heads down week. Marking blog posts, writing (lots of) PhD reference letters, updating Moodle pages and planning lectures for next term. Also spent a couple of hours trying to think how to structure a paper that reports on the Digital Frontiers living lab platform we have been working on for this past year.

Highlight of the week was eating and chatting with friends - Yaman will be leaving us shortly to start his next adventure (PhD at Cambridge). Lovely meal at [Beirut Garden](https://beirutgarden.co.uk).

Looking at [links.duncanwilson.com](https://links.duncanwilson.com/), these parts of the internet crossed my path this week:

- live map of where the [cows are in London](https://grazingmap.nofence.no/) (via Leah) 

- we won some funding to continue developing the energy monitoring work as part of our living lab activity ([UCL Grand Challenge - data empowered society](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/grand-challenges/news/2025/nov/ten-ambitious-challenge-led-projects-awarded-grants-under-ucl-data-empowered-societies))

- [Acoupi paper by Aude and Santiago](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210x.70208) up on Wiley website

- a lovely looking [water turbine](https://www.fishfriendlyhydro.co/picostream) for micro generation
