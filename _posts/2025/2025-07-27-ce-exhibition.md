Some photos this week of the MSc Connected Environments dissertation exhibition that has opened last week showcasing our students IoT design projects. They were all responding to the brief "Sense, Deploy Communicate". There was a broad variety of projects from devices sensing erosion of paths in Peru to pomodoro robots prompting better ways of working.

Was great to show some of our collaborators from other parts of UCL and industry around the projects and to see the students present their work. A great way for them to feedback how ideas prompted by their talks inspired their projects. I would also like to hat tip Leah and Simon for curating such a great exhibition - lots of work goes on behine the scenes to help the students present their work in the best light.
