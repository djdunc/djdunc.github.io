One of the most exciting emails this year came in a month or so ago – an invitation to [Science Foo Camp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Foo_Camp) from Tim O’Reilly ([O’Reilly](http://www.oreilly.com/)) and Timo Hannay ([Nature](http://www.nature.com/)) at Google Plex in Mount View, CA. Have just had a quick look at the camp wiki and it already looks like some interesting sessions on data vis are being organised and I hope the demo of the Minimum UAV takes off (excuse the pun). Next step is book the flights and upload a session suggestion around sustainability interfaces in the built environment. Must also think about what gadget I could take to demo what we are thinking about…. looking forward to August…
