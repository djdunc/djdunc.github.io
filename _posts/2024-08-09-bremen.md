Last weekend was a flying visit to Bremen to visit our son. He has spent 2 months working at the university - something to do with looking at new ways to align molecules on the surface of silicon to help improve capacity of RAM.... Had not previously been on our list of places to visit but would recommend it for a city break.

Is a lovely walkable city, very quiet with some lovely sites to visit. The Altstadt was full of narrow cobbled streets, the beer was lovely (Becks is the local brewery) and we had some lovely food ([Aioli](https://aioli-schnoor.de) and [Soulm8](https://www.soulm8.de)). We visited [the Kunsthalle](https://www.kunsthalle-bremen.de/en) and ate chips with beer by the river - whats not to like.
