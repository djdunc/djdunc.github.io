## WORK
My [blog](blog) has commentary on work activity with more official content over on the [Connected Environments](https://connected-environments.org) corner of the internet. My work social streams are at the footer of the page and for those who remember [del.icio.us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicious_(website)) I now self serve social bookmarks over on [a local install of LinkDing](https://links.duncanwilson.com/).

## PROFILE
For a quick overview of work information view the [hello](hello) section in the top navigation or jump over to [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/duncanwilson) for a longer form.

## FUN
Extra curricula making activities are in the [projects](projects) section, videos are on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/djdunc), photos are on [Flickr (pseudonomad - my original web alias!)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pseudonomad), what I'm drinking is in [whiskey](whiskey) and if you are curious about what I am listening to (other than BBC R6 / R4) then take a look at [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/djdunc) or [a spotify playlist combining lab preferences](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1EJIylJ0XoP5HI?si=09c1d1dac25242c3).
