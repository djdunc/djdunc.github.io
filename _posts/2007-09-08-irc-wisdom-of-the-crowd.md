I had fun reading the [Wisdom of Crowds by James Surowiecki](http://www.librarything.com/work/17697/book/20855814). It had been on the list to read for a while since the ideas in it (at least from what I had heard) reflected the strategy we had used in creating the Drivers of Change programme at Arup. If you go and speak to enough people then themes (drivers) that concern them start to emerge. The [Drivers of Change 2006 book](http://2006.driversofchange.com/) and the upcoming \*Rainbow\* set are the result of this collective wisdom. [Here is my review.](http://www.librarything.com/work/17697/reviews/20855814)

Other books discussed at IRC07 were:

Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking – Malcolm Gladwell (Penguin, 2006)

The Long Tail: How Endless Choice Is Creating Unlimited Demand – Chris Anderson (Random House, 2006)
