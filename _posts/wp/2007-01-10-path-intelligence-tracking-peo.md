Met with guys from [Path Intelligence](http://www.pathintelligence.com/) today. They are aiming at the holy grail of being able to track people in retail spaces without any kind of intervention being required (e.g. people wearing tags). They are using mobile phones as the tag (penetration in the UK is over 100%!!) and are measuring signal strength from radio beacons set-up around the venue. The volumes of data collected present some interesting data visualisation problemsâ€¦
