I presented our work on the [Internet of Things](http://blogs.driversofchange.com/emtech/2010/09/iot-expert-group.html) at [INTA34](http://www.inta34.org/) yesterday. The theme was “Reinventing the Urban Environment” and discussion ranged from the philosophical to the practical and was interspersed with examples of work in progress (e.g. the nearby Port of Pasaia).

I had great feedback on the Drivers of Change cards (again several people came and told me they had a set) and also on the Internet of Things work (the EU funded [Sensei project ](http://blogs.driversofchange.com/emtech/2009/10/sensei-breathes.html)and the new [TSB funded YCT project](http://blogs.driversofchange.com/emtech/2010/03/user-centred-design-for-energy.html)). I also have a pile of cards from people requesting more info on the Arup Smart City report.

My favorite speaker at the event was Clara Gaymard – President GE Europe – she gave an interesting perspective on the future of urban development and work they are doing to help cities deliver the necessary infrastructure. One line from her talk I liked was: *“a child today wishes for a computer for their birthday, their parents wished for a scooter or a car – why? They both want to be connected.”* and she also made reference to nice idea i had not heard about – City of Melbourne public transport example of smoothing peak load at no extra cost; they made public transport free before 7am. Would love to hear more about that if anyone has references.

The event was held in the Kursaal Convention Centre in the beautiful San Sebastian where we were also treated to a reception at the excellent Aquarium. I was in Santander a few weeks ago, not many mile down the coast. I was surprised to learn that both cities are going for Cultural City status in 2016 – tough competition – but was impressed with San Sebastian’s preparations. Weird highlight of the trip was being interviewed on data shadows in front of surfers out in the bay.
