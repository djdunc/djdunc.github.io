Came across this nice image of toughened glass viewed through polarised glasses on wikipedia under their [polarisation ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization)entry. I had been looking up info on [Anisotropy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisotropy) for an image analysis project I am doing at Arup. Have been implementing some basic algorithms in [processing](http://processing.org/) using co-occurance matrices and simple thresholding functionsâ€¦ might provide a low cost solution. Also getting a demo of [image pro plus](http://www.mediacy.com/) as a completely alternative route.
