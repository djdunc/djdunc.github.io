just presented Bop to John Prescott – when i spoke about the reasons why we were doing it the analogy he made was to do with military strategy in the American civil war – apparantly the red coats lost a few battles due to the heat and their inability to take off their red coats which hampered their performance due to effect of heat….

anyway, he thought it was a great project and he wanted a couple of motes for his own home.
