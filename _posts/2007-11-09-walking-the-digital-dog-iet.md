Went to the IET at Savoy Place last night to listen to [Roo Reynold’s](http://www.rooreynolds.com/) [Mountbatten Lecture](http://www.theiet.org/events/2007/mountbatten.cfm) (30th in the series and still in his 20’s, just, Roo is the youngest Mountbatten speaker by a good 20 years…)

[Roo](http://eightbar.co.uk/) works for IBM as a [Metaverse](http://www.librarything.com/work/1000167/book/21237182) evangelist. He has had significant involvement in setting up IBM’s second life activities. His talk focused on how virtual worlds are being used for work, play and learning and on the collaborative / social nature of those spaces as being the driver for their persistent use.

Best slide? I liked the question “will mmorpg’s be the new golf?” I think the original quote comes from one of the Linden Lab guys – but the analogy was people don’t play golf to get better at putting a ball in a hole it is a social activity, so is world of warcraft etc.

Also worth mentioning is a link to [IBM’s Global Innovation Outlook](http://ibm.com/gio/) site.
