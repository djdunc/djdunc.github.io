Spent time on installing UHI sensors on the UCL200 Greenwall and teaching Sustainability / SDG's this week. Great to see the UCL200 project coming together and the wooden canopy looks like it will be a good one. Looking forward to seeing how much of a social space this creates on the street. Also continued working on finalising the waterproofing of the cabling for Manifold project.

Spent a few hours working on Manifold. Currently at stage of trying to get all the component parts into a waterproof form that will be installable, maintainable and hopefully last a year. A quick site visit with team building structure and panelling was helpful to see the scale of the project and the space it will occupy.

Squeezing in capacitor

Current challenge is that one of the two 10m strands is getting some flickering. Both identical set-ups, so am assuming I have some slightly deficient solder joints somewhere underneath the waterproof shrink wrap.

Testing continuity and resistance

Looking at [links.duncanwilson.com](https://links.duncanwilson.com/), these parts of the internet crossed my path this week:

- this great desktop app [satellite eyes](https://satelliteeyes.tomtaylor.co.uk/) by Tom Taylor
- an interesting post on using AI in research [Claude code as my co-engineer from a tub of water to ultrasonic flood prediction in Cumbria](https://medium.com/@james.milward/claude-code-as-my-co-engineer-from-a-tub-of-water-to-ultrasonic-flood-prediction-in-cumbria-9d0c4e652a37)
- [a useful unconcious bias video from Royal Society](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVp9Z5k0dEE)
- an article that resonated - [UCL is 200 today - so what would founding UCL look like in 2026?](https://rainerkattel.substack.com/p/ucl-is-200-today-so-what-would-founding)
