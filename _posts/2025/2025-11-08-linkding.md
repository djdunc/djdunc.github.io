Moved my social bookmarks from [Pinboard.io](https://pinboard.in/u:dunc) across to a self serve setup on my home [Udoo SBC](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/udoo/udoo-x86-the-most-powerful-maker-board-ever/backing/details). If you look back in my [archive](https://www.iot.io/archive/) you will notice posts with “links” in the titles. I was a frequent user of [del.ici.ous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicious_(website)) for social bookmarking when doing foresight research at Arup. I moved to [Pinboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinboard_(website)) with the delicious exodus in 2010 but over the past year or so had on my todo list to move across to self hosting. After a bit of searching I ended up going for [Linkding](https://linkding.link) since I could install via docker.

Worked out the box, most my time was spent configuring the reverse proxies and cloudflare setup to be able to serve the application from my home network. The last step was to explore some custom CSS - the original intent had been to add a banner / title to personalise it. But then I came across this excellent [GIST with a card layout](https://brettterpstra.com/2024/11/18/a-card-based-layout-for-linkding/)

The results can be seen at: [https://links.duncanwilson.com/](https://links.duncanwilson.com/)

Will start to add links on here to interesting things I see such as this [Toolbox of Toolboxes website](https://www.toolboxtoolbox.com) in the screenshot above.
