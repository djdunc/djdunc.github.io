Illustration is one of my favourite forms of visual communication. I am more of a doodler capturing subconscious thoughts but since today is the first [National Illustration day](https://www.qbcentre.org.uk/quentin-blake-centre-for-illustration-national-illustration-day) I thought I would share a couple of illustrations I look at everyday.

I think I bought this poster in 2018 - it was from a collection of posters created by students for students. The brief was to depict a message of motivation.

Find some place to stop and be quiet.

This is another illustration from Maker Faire Newcastle (2014?) drawn by a delta robot. Another project that has been on my todo list for almost a decade!
