Bits and pieces this week. Metaverse book, walkshops in the park and Vespera is starting to come life. Maybe one year our walkshop in the park will also have a metaverse varient...

The Cities in the Metaverse book with Andy and Valerio is available for ordering and we have a discount code - I wrote about it [a few months ago](https://www.iot.io/blog/2025/06/07/metaverse-book.html)

One of my favourite activities with CASA students is taking them on a walkshop around the park to see urban technology in situ. I also enjoy that some students don't quite get why we are showing them this. It can feel a bit abstract the difference between a lab based prototype vs one that is actually in the wild. They will most likely learn the painful way when they try to deploy something in the field - it never quite goes to plan.

It also meant a chance to get a group photo in front of the big Marshgate UCL logo.

The Vespera build continues - finally got to test the lights with a couple of blades in place. Is going to look awesome. Simon managed to get some video using a mirror to increase the number of blades in shot.

Also managed a quick visit to Middlesbrough, saw several sunsets and sunrises like this one.
