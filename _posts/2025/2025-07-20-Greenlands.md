Van in a field

UCL Digital festival, exhibition launch (but more on that next week), graduation and drones again. Over five hours of drone flying last week at second site of airborne eDNA testing. Video highlights the very barren grassland and the lush woodland area. Was so much easier being able to get to site in the van!

Greenlands video on VIMEO

The [#ucldigifest](https://bsky.app/hashtag/ucldigifest) event went really well, lots of great discussions around digital twins and community. The keynotes from industry were also appreciated- Elizabeth from AWS gave a really interesting overview of her journey and Niall from NVIDIA showed some really interesting tools such as [Omniverse](https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/omniverse/) which reminded me I should go and take a look.

Had a lovely day at Cardiff University / Prifysgol Caerdydd graduation today as a parent. A little weird being in the theatre rather than on the stage but really enjoyed the experience and my young person had an amazing day. The Physics and Astronomy students were alongside chemistry and architecture students - highlights for me were the jumping between Welsh and English (the former is such a lovely language to listen to), the alumni video and the band ending the formal session. What a way to depart!
