We took delivery of the second Oru Kayak this week, the slightly larger Oru Beach to go alongside the Inlet. The calm weather made for a lovely paddle out to take photos of potential sites for some water height monitoring sensors. Being out on the water is also a fantastic way to end the day - a great way of resetting the mind.

I counted about 5 Moorhen nests with little chicks on yesterdays paddle.

This week we had 40 students from across UCL and CY Cergy Paris Universit√© - including 5 from CE programme. Valerio has been hosting a workshop called _"Here and There, Now and Then: Communicating Tangible and Intangible Phenomena in Urban Contexts"_ exploring the variety of ways in which data from QEOP can help tell stories about our environment. He has some excellent notes on LinkedIn [day 1](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/valerio-signorelli-91626551_day-1-international-workshop-here-and-activity-7330636827692810241-3Yge?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAIVBzIB33lKvakfnLma4-ySP1cKmMifyzE), [day 2](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/valerio-signorelli-91626551_day-2-exploring-the-queen-elizabeth-olympic-activity-7330880025405091842-qhIp?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAIVBzIB33lKvakfnLma4-ySP1cKmMifyzE), [day 3](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/valerio-signorelli-91626551_day-3-full-day-in-the-lab-working-on-protypes-activity-7331251336245575680-rxf9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAIVBzIB33lKvakfnLma4-ySP1cKmMifyzE), [day 4](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/valerio-signorelli-91626551_day-4-final-day-and-here-we-are-the-final-activity-7331597285975396352-Kw5K?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAIVBzIB33lKvakfnLma4-ySP1cKmMifyzE).

Lastly, saw this randomly on LinkedIn - is a much more elegant way of descirbing our "learning through making" approach to teaching our MSc CE: [The Knack](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/joeathome_the-knack-activity-7330177573039083522-gj0i?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAIVBzIB33lKvakfnLma4-ySP1cKmMifyzE)
