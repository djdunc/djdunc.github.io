Attended [WorkTech06 ](http://www.unwired.eu.com/worktech06.html)conference and exhibition on 7.11.06 at the British Library in London. It all sounded familiar and cannot point to anything new that stood out from the day, but was great to be inside the British Library – a great venue. The day was charied very well by Jeremy Myerson (Director of Innovation RCA) and it was good to hear Charles Handy presenting although I found myself disagreeing with his idea that the future of the corporate HQ is nearing its end. I like coming to work where there are other like minded / spirited people (i also like working at home and public spaces such as this Eurostar…). James Woudhuysen gave an excellent closing presentation / rant – just a pity Charles wasn’t there to respond…
