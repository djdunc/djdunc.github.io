After [reading DO Interesting](https://www.iot.io/blog/2023/09/10/noticing.html) last year I came across the [DO Make book](https://thedobook.co/products/do-make-the-power-of-your-own-two-hands?Format=Paperback) by the excellent [James Otter](https://ottersurfboards.co.uk/about/). The book sums up nicely why I make things. I found myself nodding all the way through and so when I got to the end I had two options, either sign up for the [week long surfboard workshop](https://ottersurfboards.co.uk/product/surfboard-workshop/) or make a hand plane - I chose the latter since it was November and I wanted to get started.

I had a small section of walnut spare from a [previous project (side table in walnut)](https://www.iot.io/projects/2018/05/01/side-table.html) which I had been planning to use for a wooden chopping board for the campervan. I thought this project could double as both! My plan had been to only use hand tools but I will confess to making use of a router since getting a smooth radius on the handle was proving challenging on the very hard walnut! So months later I finally found myself using the bobbin sander as the first person through the doors on the day of opening in the awesome [Institute of Making at Stratford](https://www.instituteofmaking.org.uk/about). After a few more rounds of shaping and sanding the hand plan was finished with a bit of Tung oil.

The [belly board workshop](https://ottersurfboards.co.uk/product/bellyboard-workshop/) is now on my wish list of things to do.
