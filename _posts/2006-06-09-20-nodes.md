Finally got all 20 nodes up and running. 1 gateway and 19 nodes with either MTS300 or MTS310 sensor boards. Had it running overnight â€“ moteview crashed a couple of times will need to try and figure out why. Need to go and review data to see how valid it looks. nice feeling to see all 20 motes networking in an adhoc mannerâ€¦. ðŸ™‚
