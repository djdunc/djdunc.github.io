A mix of making, lido benches and events this week. The greengages on the tree in the garden have started to fall, so I have started the annual ritual of making jam with the ones I can capture before they hit the ground, and clearing the mushy ones off the table and chairs. Have processed 1.6kg so far and reckon I have taken about 5% off the tree. Anyone want any greengages?

I also found myself having to make a bracket for plug socket for my sons desk - turns out the sloped edge of the table meant the bracket wasn't quite wide enough. Jumped straight to Fusion and 3D printing a solution but ended up using a rubber (eraser)! Tip for the future - when prototyping use what is around you first.

Workwise I was supporting the Bloomsberg Associates / LLDC Innovation District [report launch](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bloomberg-associates_hello-from-london-together-with-our-partners-activity-7356660171726594050-otOX?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_ios&rcm=ACoAAAIVBzIB33lKvakfnLma4-ySP1cKmMifyzE) this week. The [Field Guide for Action](https://assets.bbhub.io/dotorg/sites/38/2025/07/A-Field-Guide-for-Action.pdf) report highlights the motivation for [Innovation Districts](https://www.queenelizabetholympicpark.co.uk/business/queen-elizabeth-olympic-park-innovation-district) and how they can support local communities. They say:

> Innovation districts are an engine for growth, but can also work with communities to deliver tangible local benefits. This report offers a practical guide to developing and implementing community programmes, setting the economic and policy scene, then presenting a range of case studies to inspire and inform local strategies.

I did a brief overview of CASA research at UCL East and how we are using the campus as a Living Lab - I like that we are still showing folk around our new UCL east buildings (I wonder when they stop being new?)

Am a fan of [Open Benches](https://openbenches.org/) - managed to upload one more that I hadn't seen before at the local Lido in memory of [Susan Halter, 1948 Olympic swimmer, and Roman Halter](https://openbenches.org/bench/38738).
