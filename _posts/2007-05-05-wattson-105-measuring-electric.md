Received the [Wattson from DIYKyoto](http://www.diykyoto.com/) last week and had a quick install at home to see how it works. It has been running for 10 days and no problems so far but have not downloaded any data yet – software is to be delivered. Install was extremely simple, just clamp the current transducer (or is it a transformer?) around one of the two wires between the house electricity meter and fuse box and then turn on the wattson. Was very interesting when we first turned it on to see how many \*hidden\* appliances were running. Managed to get from 600 watts down to 80 watts by turning things off standby, however notice that it seems to average 700-800 watts in the evening. Max to date has been about 2500 watts when the dishwasher was on… Next step is to install it in Arup to monitor office appliance use…
