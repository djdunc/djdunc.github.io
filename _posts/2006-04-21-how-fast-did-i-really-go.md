[GpsActionReplay](http://users.info.unicaen.fr/~mathet/gpsar/ "GpsActionReplay (www.gpsactionreplay.com)") have been looking for this kind of GPS tool for a while – should have thought to look for an application made by / for [windsurf speed sailors](http://www.gps-speedsurfing.com/gps.asp)… Just need to download a .gpx xml file (i use [easygps](http://www.easygps.com/)) containing data for a route and then load it into the gps actionreply applet to analyse your speed over a journey (on the bike, motorbike, snowboard or windsurf session)
