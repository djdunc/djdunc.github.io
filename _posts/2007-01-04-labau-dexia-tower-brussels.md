[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.dexia-tower.com/gallery/selected/thumbs/touch_select_compressed_011.jpg?w=200)](http://www.dexia-tower.com/ "LAb[au]")Nice example of an interactive facade and building as a device that can be altered by the public. What makes this different from other similar projects is the fact that you can interact with the building \*screen\* via a kiosk. A distant camera then takes a picture of your artwork and emails it to you. Visit the site to see what images others created.
