Sometimes a picture is worth a thousand words. This week I just want to share some of the things I have seen over the past ten days.  This was probably inspired by staying up til 2am taking pictures of the Aurora Borealis from a bedroom window in North London. Probably a once in a life time opportunity.

As the days get longer we get more chance to spend time in a blooming allotment. Which includes getting the spuds in.

Graduation at Royal Festival Hall was a lovely day out and a time to chat.

Today I had the pool to myself for the last length of the lunch time session. My favourite sight is looking at the bottom of a swimming pool as the sunlight dances through the turquoise water.
