We brought together researchers from industry and academia in an Open IP environment to research, collaborate and build systems for deployment in the field. We applied creative approaches to the use of technology in an urban context and continued to innovate the IoT technologies required to deliver sustainable connected cities. The [project reports on the ICRI website](http://cities.io/about-us/) provide a summary of the 30+ projects and 150+ papers produced as a result of this work.
