For the past couple of days I have been in Brussels at the first meeting of the [Internet of Things Expert Group](http://euroalert.net/en/news.aspx?idn=10271). Introduced by Gerald Santucci and hosted by Manuel Mateo from EC DG INFSO the meeting introduced the background to the group and actions needed going forward. The focus of the group is to deliver policy recommendations to EU in 2 years time. The group has been established as a result of a previous expert group on RFID (2007-2009). It has stakeholders from a diverse range of industries (see list at bottom) and a framework for discussion has been presented as a result of EC research on this theme over past 5 years. The main action points include:

– governance (how is identification structured, who assigns ID, who is accountable, what decentralised architecture, socio economic implications such as access and exclusion)

– privacy and protection of personal data (communications on trust and privacy, “right to silence the chips”, “privacy by design” ie one of the primary technology blocks from outset not added in as required functionality later)

– trust, acceptance and security \[individual | business\] (following ENISA work on identification of risks)

– standardization (extend existing to cover IoT, develop / extend new given emerging IoT)

and the group will also:

– feed opinion into FP7 projects and CIP’s for innovation / pilot projects

– institutional awareness – inform other European institutions about IoT

– international dialogue – japan, china, korea, usa

– waste – pros and cons in recycling process

– focus on development – monitoring introduction of IoT tech (Eurostat starting to monitor)

On the latter point a comment was made on how to measure the output – there are many Smart Cities emerging but how do we assess or measure the resultant interventions. Given that comparitive assessment is hard (e.g. Santander vs Amsterdam, London vs Melbourne) what metrics should we use?
