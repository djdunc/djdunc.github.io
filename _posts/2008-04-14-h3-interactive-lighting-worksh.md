We have been working with [Tinker.it](http://www.tinker.it/en/Main/HomePage) here in London in organising a few workshops around Arduino. The first is on Interactive Lighting and will involve a mix of presentations on current state of the art and building some simple protoypes. Guest talks include our own [Francesco Anselmo](http://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/index.php), [Massimo Banzi](http://www.tinker.it/en/People/HomePage) from Tinker.it and Daniel Hirschmann from [Jason Bruges Studio](http://www.jasonbruges.com/). The giveaway swag to all attendees include a DMX controller and a DMX shield for Arduino.
