Whilst in Helsinki i could not resist going to the [Left Foot Company](https://shop.leftfootcompany.com/2007/Frontpage.aspx) and getting measured for a pair of shoes. This was definately the most pleasant shoe purchase i have ever made. Extremely friendly (not pushy) staff, quick but thorough service and in a location that seemed like someones living room. You simply [put on some gridded socks, stand on a table, watch as a camera rotates around your feet ](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pseudonomad/543566120/in/photostream/)and hey presto – a 3D map of your feet. Many thanks to Piia for emailing me the screen shot of my feet!

Mass customisation has been a driver of change that has been appearing in many of our future of retail workshops. Nice to actually have some real experience of this… This also reminds me of the [SizeUK](http://www.fashion.arts.ac.uk/sizeuk.htm) project and a product offering from [Bodymetrics](http://www.bodymetrics.com/main.html).

btw i ended up going for the 5th Ave’s with rubber sole…
