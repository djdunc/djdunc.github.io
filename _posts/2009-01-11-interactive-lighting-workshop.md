A second interactive lighting workshop is being held at Arup, organised by Tinker with presentations from Arup, [UVA](http://www.uva.co.uk/) and [Philips Lighting](http://www.lighting.philips.com/in_en/global_sites/led_lighting/index.php?main=gb_en&parent=1&id=in_en_led_lighting&lang=en).

The workshop will cover an intro to DMX control using Arduino, examples and stories from light installations by Arup, UVA and Tinker, insight into emerging technologies and products from Philips and access to DMX controllable installations ([Forcefield](http://blogs.driversofchange.com/emtech/2009/01/forcefield_interactive.html), and Optimise) so that you can test your learning on real installations.

If you are interested in hacking DMX controlled lights with Arduino or just want to learn about how interactive light installations work then why not join usâ€¦ the project page is on the [Tinker site](http://tinkerit.eventwax.com/interactive-lighting-workshop)
