According to psychologists, we tell between six and 200 lies a day in order to socialise (’I'm fine’), for play and fun, to hide misbehaviour, feel safer, feel private, feel better about the world for ourselves and to try to be more popular. There are lots of good (and bad) reasons to dissemble.</div><div class="delicious-tags">(tags: [convergence](http://delicious.com/djdunc/convergence) [selfsurveillance](http://delicious.com/djdunc/selfsurveillance))</div>
