A week before the opening of UCL East Marshgate I happened to be in building for a meeting - love seeing the behind the scenes of art installations. This one is [Gaia](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pseudonomad/53190187484/) (more in a few weeks), I do like a serendipitous Timelapse.

I missed the Marshgate opening day unfortunately but colleagues said there was a real buzz and sense of excitement about the opportunity for collaborative research. Several videos of media coverage are [on Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:dunc/t:marshgate/t:opening/).
