[ Engineering Management Hacks: The BigBook Technique”&gt;![](https://i0.wp.com/radar.oreilly.com/images/header_radar_logo.gif?w=160)](http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/05/engineering_management_hacks_t.html) A reminder to myself about the mythical man month:

> When a task cannot be partitioned because of sequential constraints, the application of more effort has no effect on the schedule. The bearing of a child takes nine months, no matter how many women are assigned. Many software tasks have this characteristic because of the sequential nature of debugging. In tasks that can be partitioned but which require communication among the subtasks, the effort of communication must be added to the amount of work to be done. \[…\] Oversimplifying outrageously, we state Brooks’s Law: Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.
