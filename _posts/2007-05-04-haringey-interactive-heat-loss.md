[Nice project for Haringey Council](http://www.seeit.co.uk/haringey/Map.cfm) by [Hot Mapping](http://www.hotmapping.co.uk/london/index.htm/) and [Horton Levi](http://www.hortonlevi.co.uk/). The aerial survey measured heat loss from every property by taking thermal images. The council claim this piece of work was completed for under 21k GBP. My house is shown circled below – not bad considering our poor level of insulation – but i did not live here (in 2000) and cannot be sure if, for example, any heating was on when [Horton-Levi](http://www.hortonlevi.co.uk/) conducted the aerial thermal survey of the whole of London.
