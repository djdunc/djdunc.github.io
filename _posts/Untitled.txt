
just did a recalculation with the beam height and I believe that the beams were under water for:
Aug – 10 hours
Sept – 13 hours
 
Feels like that would be a good metric to be calculating in the future. It is hard to automate this at moment due to noise in my sensor readings but am working to fix that.
