The Arup Foresight Innovation and Incubation team was invited to exhibit in a Design Studio at the [National Retail Federation Convention &amp; Expo](http://nrf.a2zinc.net/annual07/public/enter.aspx) (12th-14th Jan). The emphasis of the three-day studio programme was to raise awareness of the importance of design in retail.

Arup presence included an exhibit in the design studio reflecting our Songdo, Prada and Wal-Mart retail projects, an interactive Drivers of Change application surveying delegates opinion on what may drive change in the future of retail and Chris Luebkeman’s keynote presentation to 2000+ delegates on “The future is over-sold and under-imagined”

The event at the Jacob K Javits Convention Center, New York City, is the biggest retail convention of its kind, all the big players in retail were there, from IBM, through Google, to Microsoft. The organisers of the event are very keen to see more input from design firms working in retail in future events.
