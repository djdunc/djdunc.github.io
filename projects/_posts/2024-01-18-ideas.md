One of my favourite January jobs is thinking about potential summer projects - both for self and for student dissertations. As we start to get the students thinking about potential projects we also present some ideas of things we would work on if we had 5 months to develop a project. A couple of my favourites this year are "Ambient Portals" (_an interactive installation to ask the research question: do staff engage with ambient devices that communicate activity across dislocated offices? “a nabztag for offices rather than divorcees”_) and "Jump Buddy" (_A member of Pool Street staff is a potential future Olympic equestrian. We are keen to develop a device that can be worn by the rider to give either real-time performance information or post activity guidance to help improve performance._)

Projects added this year are below. The full list is archived over at [https://www.iot.io/ideas/](https://www.iot.io/ideas/).

## Ambient portals [2024]
CASA have two locations at UCL East and Bloomsbury. The objective of this project would be to test an interactive installation to ask the research question: do staff engage with ambient devices that communicate activity across dislocated offices? "a nabztag for offices rather than divorcees"

## Building dashboard [2024]
Is it possible to visualise the health of a building? This project will utilise live data from the building (energy usage, environment data, occupancy) to communicate a narrative for the performance of the systems that control our built environment. We are particularly interested in ways of communicating this information to a general audience.

## Jump Buddy [2024]
A member of Pool Street staff is a potential future Olympic equestrian. We are keen to develop a device that can be worn by the rider to give either real-time performance information or post activity guidance to help improve performance. 

## Small acts of kindness [2024]
A cycle helmet / bib / bike lights that communicate messages of thanks to those who share the roadspace with cyclists. Control could be based on gestures / physical inputs that explore new forms of human computer interface.

## At one with the building [2024] 
A suspended VR experience driven by realtime data from the building. We have millions of zeros and ones that flow through our building representing the state of the space. In this project we want to explore how sitting in a hammock, suspended in space, can support alternative ways of experiencing that data (e.g. flowing with the data, playing with the data, hearing the data...)

## Smart walls [2024]
Build a reconfigurable work space that is parametric by design, can easily be manufactured in the LFW and supports sensing of space usage to allow for evaluation and adaption. Building on existing experimentation at Moorfields Eye Hospital (pop up eye clinics) this project would develop a reconfigurable and integrated space design system monitored using an iteration of the CE COACH sensor platform.
