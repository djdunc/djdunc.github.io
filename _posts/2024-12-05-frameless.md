I am on a cultural roll at the moment. One of the joys of living in London is access to the variety of culture it offers. Whether it's historic landmarks, world-class museums, or innovative new spaces, the city constantly invites us to discover and rediscover art in fresh ways. This week, my sister was visiting, so I took a midweek day off, and we spent some time exploring central London, including a visit to [Frameless](https://frameless.com).

The immersive environment at Frameless was a very different way to experience some well-known artworks. Being surrounded by moving projections and carefully designed soundscapes gives a fresh appreciation for what it might have been like being where the pieces of art were created. The scale and format provided a chance to look at familiar works in a new way, focusing on elements that I might not have seen in a traditional gallery setting. It was an interesting blend of engineering and art, creating a unique way to engage with visual storytelling.

What stood out to me most about the visit was how relaxing it felt. Moving through the space at a steady rate, dictated by the length of the animation loops, with the combination of visuals and sound, created a calming atmosphere. Unlike some traditional art experiences, there was no pressure to interpret or analyze—just an opportunity to take it in and enjoy. It felt like a great example of how thoughtful design can make culture more accessible and enjoyable. 

I also came away with some ideas for ambient data projections in the lab... Well worth a visit if you get chance.
