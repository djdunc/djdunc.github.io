Spent a really interesting morning at one of the Arup Design Schools – thanks to Richard and Richard for the invite! Notes from the event were [tweeted](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=arupdesignschool) but i only tagged the last one, photos are on [flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pseudonomad/sets/72157616332660332/) and the slides are on [slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/djdunc/design-school-data-in-the-be).
