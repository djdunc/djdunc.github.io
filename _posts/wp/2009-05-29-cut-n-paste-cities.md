***A global call to action and an invitation to urban dwellers to describe through photography the places and things they love about their cities, and those that they could do without.***

Cutnpastecities launched this week out of the foresight team at Arup. The brief is to capture through photography what you really like in a city, what makes it tick, and what you would like to see more of in the future. They can be spaces or services, aspects of everyday life or temporary events. Alternatively, describe something that should be removed from the city, a building you could do without, a service that just doesn’t work. These are a CUT. Things you like are a PASTE.

The project will culminate with an exhibition of curated insights, stories and speculations based on the images.

To get started all you need is a photo you have taken with a few keywords that highlight what is special about that place or aspect of the city, along with a description of what you would CUT or PASTE.

<big>How do I submit a photo?</big>

If you are a Flickr user add them to the [cutnpastecities group](http://www.flickr.com/groups/cutnpastecities/). Or if email is easier then just send them to <photo@cutnpastecities.com> with the following information:

\* is it a CUT or a PASTE?

\* what you like or dislike, specifically

\* add some tags that describe the content of the photo

\* describe the location (address or city or geocode, adding to the map)

<big>Any rules?</big>

The photo must be one that you have taken, and one that we can use with your permission. The photo remains your intellectual property; cutnpaste cities will credit you as you wish. Any size and resolution is accepted.
